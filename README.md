# krasCGQ's Personal Scripts

This small repository hosts personal scripts used on my PCs and build server. They'll always be updated when needed. If you feel any of these scripts suit your needs, feel free to use, star this repository and revisit whenever the scripts get updated. Adjustments to your directories are needed.

Enjoy!
