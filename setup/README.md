## Kras' personal environment setup script

To make use of this script on a cleanly installed Termux, run:

```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krasCGQ/scripts/master/setup/termux.bash | bash -
```

Replace `master` with `staging` if you want to test staging script.

You need to restart Termux (or create a new window) for shell changes to be applied.

### Notice

Since it's a personal setup, don't expect something stupid like tons of packages installed by default.
